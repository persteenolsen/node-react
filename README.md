# NodeCrud

Show, Create, Update and Delete Persons by a React and a Node.js App without using framework like Express

- Node.js
- Besides a MySQL NPM package no framework like Express was used
- React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES5 and ES6
- Bootstrap for the responsive design
- MySQL as the database
- Micosoft Azure App Service as cloud hosting using Windows and iisnode
- Visual Studio Code as Text Editor

Note: If using the files: "nodeapp_get.js" you must change the React module in "listpersonsreact.jsx" to match the functionality for only show persons (nodeapp_get.js). Just change the React file: "listpersonsreact.jsx" in the public folder and leave the other React-files there.
